# Ski-Resort-Database
Collaborative database project between Luckie Musngi and Aj Becerra

This is the final project for our Database Design class.
We were given an application domain and a list of queries that must be possible.
The Schema, planning, and application were done without further assistance.

To run in lectura:

    Add the Oracle JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH environment variable using:
        export CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/oracle/19.8/client64/lib/ojdbc8.jar:${CLASSPATH}

    Compile DBMSetup.java using:
        javac DBMSSetup.java

    Compile Interface.java using:
        javac Interface.java
    
    Run DBMSSetup.java
        java DBMSSetup

    This will both create the tables and populate them with values that make sense

    Run Interface.java
        java Interface

    Follow the instructions of this interface to do modify and query the database


    For both of these files, you will need to sign in with your oracle username and password
