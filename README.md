# Ski-Resort-Database
Collaborative database project between Luckie Musngi and Aj Becerra

This is the final project for our Database Design class.

We were given the following application domain and a list of queries that must be possible"

"As a ski resort striving to stand out in the local tourism market, we have recently expanded our
facilities to include a comprehensive entertainment and leisure area. This aims to enhance the
overall customer experience and attract more families and young visitors. While ski passes and
skiing activities remain our primary sources of revenue, we also wish to develop this integrated
area into a highlight of its own. To achieve this, we hope to build a system that enables close
integration between the skiing area and entertainment facilities, thereby improving both customer
experience and operational efficiency for staff.
The ski resort owns different types of properties, including multiple lodges that offer dining options,
several gift shops, a rental center, a visitor center where visitors can buy passes, a ski school, free
parking lots, and paid parking lots. The ski resort offers free shuttle service between properties for
visitors. The stakeholder may want to keep track of the daily income from different sources.
Before using any skiing facilities, customers must first register as members. For each member,
we collect a basic yet essential set of information, e.g., name, telephone number, email address,
date of birth, and emergency contact. Once registration is complete, members may purchase ski
passes, rent equipment, and begin their skiing journey either through self-service kiosks or at the
front desk. To manage access and skiing rights within the resort, we have designed a “Ski Pass”
module. The system should comprehensively track information such as the total number of uses,
remaining uses, time of purchase, expiration date, and associated member account. To note, we
offer different types of passes, e.g., 1-day, 2-day, 4-day, and season passes.
The ski resort provides equipment rental services to visitors who need them. Equipment rental is
tied to the ski pass: one use of the ski pass allows for one equipment rental. Equipment includes
ski boots, ski poles, skis (both snowboard and alpine), and protective gear. Ski boots range from
size 4 to 14 with half sizes, the length of ski poles ranges from 100cm to 140cm (integer), the length
of ski ranges from 115cm to 200cm (integer), and the length of snowboard ranges from 90cm to
178cm (integer). The system must manage inventory and rental records.
The ski resort has a lot of trails for visitors to have fun. Each trail contains the start and end
location, status for open, the difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, expert, for simplicity), and
category (groomed, park, moguls, and glade skiing). We also want to offer different names for each
trail so that people can easily remember them. Feel free to come up with creative names.
To reach the trails on the mountain, visitors can take the lifts. Each lift has its unique name
for people to remember. To prevent possible accidents, the lift should indicate its ability level
(beginner, intermediate, expert, for simplicity) to better accommodate the visitors. Each lift has
a regular open and close time within a day for visitor to plan their runs in the resort. Besides,
visitors also want to know which trails each lift takes them to. Visitors also want to check their
status before they visit, since some of the lifts may open later in the season for a deeper snow
cover. Members scan their ski pass at the entrance of the lift. A valid entry counts as one ski pass
use. The system records all entry logs for people who want to check their statistics.
The ski school offers ski lessons for kids and adults. The resort employs PSIA-AASI certified
instructors (Level I, II, III). Instructors can manage private and group lessons. The system must
store lesson schedules, purchases, and usage records.
The ski resort employs a lot of people to maintain the service. Their job positions should cover
all the services provided above. The ski resort also wants to keep track of employees’ demographic
information and employment start dates. Besides, the stakeholder wants to know the gross income
per month by calculating the difference between the monthly income from all the properties and
the monthly salary paid to every employee."
